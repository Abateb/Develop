# Project description

### The GW coding bootcamp motivated me to do this code refactoring.

### Horiseon is a marketing agency and require a codebase that follows accesibility standards so the site is optimzed for search engines.

### I worked on this project after coming across it as an assignment.

### HTML structure has been modified.

### Semantic html has been applied so that elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and pos, 'alt' attributes added to image elements, Title changed to be descriptive as requested by client.

### This project has solved the excessively used 'div' element by using semantic structure, shorthand applied to CSS file for a tidier layout.

### Doing this project I learned how to use semantic html, Use a meaningful Title, making sure all images have 'alt' attributes and meet accesibility standards.
